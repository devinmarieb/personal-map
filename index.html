    <p class="about">Hi boys. I'm Tina. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. Dr. Yap is dreamy. When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking into my soul. Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. It's a mating list for when the world ends. Can I get your email? The hand wants what the hand wants. If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the morningâ€¦that ship has sailed. Time for the charm bomb to explode. Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. Dear Diary: Tonight I'm sneaking off to the abandoned taffy factory to look for treasure. Also, if boys had uteruses, they'd be called duderuses. You had me at horses, but then you lost me at corpses. I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. I need both ears to hold up my glasses.
    Please don't tell Mom and Dad. My crotch is itchy. Your body. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. Not if you're a fish. Dear God, this is Tina from school. I've been using the toilet like an idiot. Drop the towel. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go. My boob? It's not meant to be hilarious. It's supposed to be erotic. I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. Dr. Yap is dreamy. When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking into my soul.
    I need both ears to hold up my glasses. If you need me, I'll be down here on the floor. Dying. Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? Hi boys. I'm Tina. I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill with one free hand. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. You won't regret it, dad. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. under the disco ball, it'll be like we're all        kissing Jimmy Jr under the disco ball. It's an erotic friend fiction story that I just wrote. I hope you like it, because you're all in it. It's called 'Buttloose.' I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just wants to go home. The hand wants what the hand wants.
